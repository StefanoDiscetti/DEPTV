This folder contains two different MATLAB codes:
 1: main_debug.m - Sample code comparing PIV and DEPTV algorithms with the true DNS flow field
 2: main.m       - Sample code comparing PIV and DEPTV algorithms, intended to be modified by the user

The codes use a k-d tree function from Andrea Tagliasacchi: https://github.com/ataiya/kdtree
The DNS dataset has been modified from the Dynamic Mode Decomposition book: http://dmdbook.com/
Some plots are generated using a subtightplot function from Felipe G. Nievinski
